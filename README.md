With the exception of KB experiments and set2IT095, all plant experiments are paired technical replicates sequenced separately.  
Sequencing replicates of time0 samples were combined for a given experiment.  
For the analysis in this paper, fitness values from technical replicates were calculated separately, and averaged for a given experiment.
