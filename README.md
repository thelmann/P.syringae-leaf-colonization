set3IT031	in planta		epiphytic; Green bean  
set3IT032	in planta		epiphytic; Green bean  
set6IT083	in planta		apoplastic; Green bean; 6 days  
set6IT084	in planta		apoplastic; Green bean; 6 days  
set1IT049	in planta	epiphytic	Green bean; epiphytic  
set1IT050	in planta	epiphytic	Green bean; epiphytic  

With the exception of KB experiments and set2IT095, all experiments are paired technical replicates sequenced separately.
For the analysis in this paper, fitness values from technical replicates were averaged for a given experiment.
